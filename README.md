# Work-Day-Scheduler
In this scheduler, the user will be able to plan any objectives they have throughout the day.

The time starts at 9am and ends at 5pm.

The time blocks are color coded so the user will be able to see when an objective is past the hour, when youre on the current hour, and any future objectives.

When the current hour is past previous, the time block will display gray. When the hour is current, the time block will display red, and when the time block is in the future, it will display green.
